 conv.political.1.a:0 "At least we know who'll control the country..."
 conv.political.1.b:0 "Our Democracy is sacred!"
 conv.political.1.d:0 "The government is weak, they say. Power should be held by just one member, they shout..."
 conv.political.1.t:0 "Absolutism on the Rise"
 conv.political.10.c:0 "At the end, a state must respect the will of its people. [Root.GetName] will hold the referendum"
 conv.political.10.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] is only seen as a usurper by these evergrowing movements in [Root.GetName]. Soon, [Root.GetAdjective] people will revolt against the government, asking for a strong leader chosen by God Almighty. They are now demanding by us to make all humans who believe in the only God to choose whether they want the monarchy or the current regime."
 conv.political.10.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Reactionaries demanding referendum"
 conv.political.11.c:0 "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 conv.political.11.d:0 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 conv.political.11.t:0 "Communists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.12.c:0 "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 conv.political.12.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 conv.political.12.t:0 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.13.a:0 "Time to show these mediæval protesters how modern war is done."
 conv.political.13.b:0 "In the name of God Almighty, may He choose who to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.13.d:0 "Oh, [Root.GetLeader], the people thought you were not chosen by God and they tried to persuade you to do a referendum. But having you denied them, they preferred to do the will of God Almighty by themselves."
 conv.political.13.t:0 "For God to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.14.a:0 "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 conv.political.14.b:0 "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 conv.political.14.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 conv.political.14.t:0 "Communists Rise Up"
 conv.political.15.a:0 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 conv.political.15.b:0 "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 conv.political.15.d:0 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 conv.political.15.t:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 conv.political.16.a:0 "Pathetic, that's the right word."
 conv.political.16.d:0 "The self-styled King of [Root.GetName] is now dead and his followers forgot how to fight. The people learnt the lesson, our regime is protected by God more than those pathetic old men yelling at clouds."
 conv.political.16.t:0 "Fanatic Reactionaries defeated"
 conv.political.17.a:0 "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 conv.political.17.d:0 "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 conv.political.17.t:0 "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 conv.political.18.a:0 "What a bunch of quitters."
 conv.political.18.d:0 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 conv.political.18.t:0 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 conv.political.19.a:0 "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.19.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Abandons Neutral Foreign Policy"
 conv.political.19_absolutist:0 "The path of monarchy is safer. Absolutism will it be."
 conv.political.19_communism:0 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. This country has always stood on it principles and been ready to defend them. We are no longer safe on our own. Neutrality is no longer the safe haven it used to be and those who seek power in this world do not respect it. We must stand with our communist brothers against the powers that seek to oppress us. Against the bourgeois majority who wants nothing more than keep us down. If we do not take a stand, we will perish alone.'"
 conv.political.2.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 conv.political.2.b:0 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 conv.political.2.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 conv.political.2.t:0 "Communism on the Rise"
 conv.political.3.a:0 "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 conv.political.3.b:0 "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 conv.political.3.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 conv.political.3.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 conv.political.4.a:0 "Our only hope is that they won't organize a coup against us"
 conv.political.4.d:0 "Some may say these are just old man yelling at clouds, but the Reactionary movement is costantly gaining new supporters. What should the government do about this, however, is difficult to tell."
 conv.political.4.t:0 "Reactionary Ideas spreading throughout [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.5.a:0 "*Sigh*, maybe we could give them that figure to avoid the destruction of [Root.GetName]?"
 conv.political.5.d:0 "Our glorious regime is being menaced by our own soldiers. They claim for a strong figure of power, chosen by God Almighty. It will only be a matter of time before they'll embrace arms publicely against [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.5.t:0 "Absolutist Soldiers won't pledge allegiance to [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.6.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 conv.political.6.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 conv.political.6.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.7.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.7.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 conv.political.7.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 conv.political.8.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 conv.political.8.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 conv.political.8.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 conv.political.9.a:0 "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 conv.political.9.b:0 "Let the people be heard."
 conv.political.9.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
